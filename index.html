<p>Like the eye of Sauron in Lord of the Rings, you stand in VR atop a tall tower overlooking a vast landscape. Creatures march towards you from all directions, and you must beat them back<br>
    with spells that you cast using hand-tracking controls. In this vertical slice, when your hand is outstretched, a lightning spell can be cast to slice across the land and decimate your <br>
    enemies.
</p>
<p>
    Tower of Doom is a PCVR game made in Unreal Engine 5. We created this vertical slice as our quarter-long senior capstone project for CMPM 171: Game Design Studio at UC Santa Cruz.<br>
    The goal of the project was to collaborate with a team to prototype and build a vertical slice that we could potentially expand upon and polish in the following course, CMPM 172.<br>
    As part of the assignment, our game was created with the following constraints, meant to make our games more accessible:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Playable with limited vision (e.g. colorblindness)</li>
        <li>Playable with one hand</li>
        <li>Playable without sound</li>
        <li>Localized to support at least two languages</li>
        <li>Under a certain filesize</li>
        <li>Can be played in short bursts with natural breaks in gameplay</li>
    </ul>
    We had to be considerate of these requirements as we made choices about gameplay and how we conveyed information in our game. For example, the lightning spell playable in the<br>
    vertical slice can be cast with one hand, and just one hand at a time, and the enemies' health and numbers are balanced around one-handed gameplay. We also chose to convey<br>
    information visually or through gameplay rather than through text where we could, minimizing the amount of English reading necessary to play.

    <h3>Team members</h3>
    <label>Arman Jordan - Lead gameplay programmer and designer, sound engineer, environment design, visual effects<br></label>
    <p class="tab">I came up with the idea, designed/programmed the game, created the environment, did the soundwork, the art choices/modeling, the spellcasting, visual polish, enemy/AI, pathfinding setup,<br>
        win and loss condition, and worked on VR support.</p>
    <label>Marcus Williamson - VR programmer<br></label>
        <p class="tab">I implemented integration with VR and VR controls, as well as the splash screen. Getting hand tracking to work was a little tricky since this was my first major Unreal project<br>
        and support for hand tracking is relatively limited, but I found a workaround that would allow for hand tracking and controller to work.</p>
</p>

<h3>Prototypes</h3>
<img width = "640" height = "480" src="prototype1.png">
<p> One of our first prototypes shows where the heart of our idea originated. To use well designed hand motions to evoke spells<br>
    Each of the spells had to look and feel unique, offering something new for the player to toy with.
</p>
<br>

<img width = "640" height = "480" src="prototype3.png">
<p> Early iterations of our environment allowed us to be more grounded with our vision.<br>
    We began to brainstorm features for a full game to ensure this vertical slice was worth making.
</p>
<br>

<img width = "640" height = "480" src="prototype4.png">
<p> Our early prototypes were in first person, not VR. Through this method, we were able to quickly construct<br>
    a playable experience. Playtesting led to iteration, and development began.
</p>
<br>

<img width = "640" height = "480" src="prototype5.png">
<p> We soon established a navigation map for the enemy AI to traverse. We created spawners that took as input an enemy model/anim<br>
    and would periodically spawn the enemy type with random presets for health, speed, anim speed, and size.
